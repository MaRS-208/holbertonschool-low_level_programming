PID & PPID

	A process is an instance of an executing program, that has a unique process ID. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current processâ€™ ID, you can use the system call getpid (man 2 getpid).

	Note in the example above, that every time you run the program, a new process is created, and its ID is different.

	Each process has a parent: the process that created it. It is possible to get the PID of a parent process by using the getppid system call (man 2 getppid), from within the child process.

Exercises

	0. getppid

	Write a program that prints the PID of the parent process. Run your program several times within the same shell. It should be the same. Does echo $$ print the same value? Why?

	1. /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max

	Write a shell script that prints the maximum value a process ID can be.
